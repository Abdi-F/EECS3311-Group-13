ITERATION 1 START

First Meeting: January 31st 2023 - 40min

* spoke about creation of class diagram and general flow of the program
* Talked about GUI implementation
* Spoke about design philosophies, and how we can future proof our code
* Began preliminary divvying up of the work

Meeting 2: February 1st 2023 - 30min
* Reviewed an initial UI design and defined app's usage patterns
* Reviewed an initial 3-layer architecture plan for app
* Identified required additions for the app UI (add window for new items)
  and potential modifications to the architecture to better reflect software 
  design principles. These draft documents are uploaded on Github.
* Discussed potential implementations of persistence storage for different data
  based on the requirements of the data to be stored.
* Discussed a potential plan to divide development work by classes.

Meeting 3: Feburary 4th 2023 - 40min
*Discussed improvements to architecture
*Discussed how we will implement our designs
*Discussed potential changes towards the inital UI design
*Set a timeline in place for iteration 1
*Clarified responsibilites 
*Discussed potential future features in later iterations as well as its compatability and thoughts on its general implementation 

Meeting 4: February 6th 2023 - 1h 15min
* Began implementation of basic application design
* Chose to follow MVC model for GUI development to follow Observer Software Design Pattern (for better interactivity with user)
* Division of code amongst team members by assigning implementation of different layers (to rely on abstraction of each others' code so we don't need to know how each member implemented their code).
* Assigning developer tasks for remaining implementation.

Iteration 1 Developer Tasks

Abdirahman Farah
*Tasks chosen: Implementation of stub database, main GUI window, some backend search add and remove implementations
*Related user stories: Adding and removing items, compressed view layout, food item search
*Expected dev times: Add 7 days, Remove 8 days, View 6 days, Search 8 days
*Above user stories were split with others in the group, leaving me with half the amount for each.
*Actual dev times: Search 5 days, Add 2 days, Remove 2 days, View 3 days

Prabjot Dhaliwal
* Task Chosen: Implementing StockableItem and StoredItem interface and concrete subclasses, adding item GUI window.
* Related User Stories: Adding items from selected list, manually adding user-defined items, incrementing/decrementing item quanities.
* Expected Dev Times: Add (6 days), Remove (2 days), View (5 days)
* Actual Dev Times: Add (5 days), Remove (1 day), View (3 days)

Karim Jaouhar
* Tasks Chosen: Implement Fridge class, inventory inferface, and Fridge Item Class. And Create Iteration 1 UI Design
* Related User Stories: Adding and Removing Items From Fridge
* Expected Dev Times: Fridge class (4 days), FridgeItem class (3 days), inventoryInterface(1 day), GUI Design (2)
* Actual Dev Times: Fridge class (3 days), FridgeItem class (2 days), inventoryInterface(1 day), GUI Design (3)

Eric Cha
*Tasks Chosen: GUI (failed to implement and group members had to take over), some light checks and touchups on existing implementations 
*Related User Stories: compressed view layout (failed to implement and group members had to take over)
*Expected Dev Times: view 6 days (failed to implement and group members had to take over), others n/a
*Actual Dev Times: view 3 days (failed to implement and group members had to take over), others 1 day

ITERATION 2 START

Meeting 5: February 13, 2023 - 1h
* Defined detailed user stories for iteration 2 and assigned their priorities and costs.
* Reviewed and discussed the application developed by Group 12 which we are the clients for.
* Drafted a list of features that we would like to see added to Group 12's application.
* Outlined key tasks to finish in the week:
  * GUI Features missing from Iteration 1 (Remove item, expressive view layout toggle)
  * Implementation of real Database and designing persistent storage
  * Testing for Domain logic
  * Refactoring clunky design of GUI to fit design patterns better

Meeting with Client Team: February 16, 2023 - 15 min
* Bug Found: Incrementing item will increment all items that contain the same name.
* Allow the user to add items without opening new window, or close 'Add Item Window' after an item is added. (To reduce clutter)
* Clear input text field after it has been submitted, to allow user to easily enter in new input.
* Allow the user to see all items in the DB immediately, rather than have to search themselves to see a list.

Meeting with Dev Team (as Client): February 16, 2023 - 30 min
* Design Problem: Create app for both librarian admin and users, or just users
* Contradictory Planning: Both selling and borrowing books
* Suggested Features to implement listed in the following document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZaxJnpQ-Yp6XRaxLBqMg2T5EU32Zh_2dO_4kNkW1Dd0/edit#
* Discussed reconsidering order of user stories in iteration 2/3 to prioritize key features such as borrowing books
