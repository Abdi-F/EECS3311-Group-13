First Meeting: January 31st 2023 - 40min

* spoke about creation of class diagram and general flow of the program
* Talked about GUI implementation
* Spoke about design philosophies, and how we can future proof our code
* Began preliminary divvying up of the work

Meeting 2: February 1st 2023 - 30min
* Reviewed an initial UI design and defined app's usage patterns
* Reviewed an initial 3-layer architecture plan for app
* Identified required additions for the app UI (add window for new items)
  and potential modifications to the architecture to better reflect software 
  design principles. These draft documents are uploaded on Github.
* Discussed potential implementations of persistence storage for different data
  based on the requirements of the data to be stored.
* Discussed a potential plan to divide development work by classes.

Meeting 3: Feburary 4th 2023 - 40min
*Discussed improvements to architecture
*Discussed how we will implement our designs
*Discussed potential changes towards the inital UI design
*Set a timeline in place for iteration 1
*Clarified responsibilites 
*Discussed potential future features in later iterations as well as its compatability and thoughts on its general implementation 

Meeting 4: February 6th 2023 - 1h 15min
* Began implementation of basic application design
* Chose to follow MVC model for GUI development to follow Observer Software Design Pattern (for better interactivity with user)
* Division of code amongst team members by assigning implementation of different layers (to rely on abstraction of each others' code so we don't need to know how each member implemented their code).
* Assigning developer tasks for remaining implementation.
